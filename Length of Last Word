Problem Description

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

Given s = "Hello World",


return 5 as length("World") = 5.

Please make sure you try to solve this problem without using library functions. Make sure you only traverse the string once.









int Solution::lengthOfLastWord(const string A) {
    int n = A.size();
    int count = 0;
    for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
    {
        if(A[i]!=' ')
            count++;
        else if(count!=0)
            return count;
    }
    return count;
}
