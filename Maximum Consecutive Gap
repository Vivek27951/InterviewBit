Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Example :

Input : [1, 10, 5]
Output : 5 
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

You may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
You may also assume that the difference will not overflow.






int Solution::maximumGap(const vector<int> &A) {
    vector<int> arr = A;
    sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
    int maxi = 0;
    for(int i=1;i<arr.size();i++)
    {
        maxi = max(maxi,arr[i]-arr[i-1]);
    }
    return maxi;
}
